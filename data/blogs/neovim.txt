short_description:Neovim - the new Vim. Let's talk about the cool things around Neovim and how to get started. I'll provide links to some fantastic plugins that you might want to check out.
description:I have been using Vim for quite some time now and I can attest that
it has helped me code faster and my hands remain in a small area of the keyboard rather than requiring me to switch from the keys to the mouse and back again (crazy).
Vi is a highly configurable, command-line & keyboard-based text editor originally developed for the Unix OS by Bill Joy. Vim is Vi Improved (do write in the comments about the improvements).
Neovim is a refactor, continuation, and extension of Vim (https://neovim.io/charter/). It is a project to make Vim more extensible, and usable. Nvim uses Lua for plugins and configs. However, the intention is not to replace VimScript.
With a package manager like Packer (written in Lua), it is very easy to install and manage plugins. So here's the list of important plugins everyone should be using.
